# Configuration

Everything personal lives in `data/` (gitignored) or the Keychain. Tracked files hold only shared code and generic examples, so a fork can pull upstream without conflicts ([FORKING.md](../../FORKING.md)).

## Where things live

| Where | What |
| --- | --- |
| `data/omni.config.json` | You, your folders, integrations (Hermes URL, central brain), automation on/off. Every field: `omni.config.example.json` |
| `data/crew/*.md` | Your own version of a crew charter; replaces the one in `crew/` with the same name |
| `data/automations/*.yaml` | Your own automations; one with the same id as a shared one replaces it |
| `.env` | Server options (port, model defaults, concurrency). Example: `.env.example`. An env var wins over the config file |
| Keychain | Secret values. The database keeps their names only |

`npm run setup` or the first-run screens write `data/omni.config.json` ([Install](install.md#set-up-by-hand)). Change it later in **Settings** (web, `#/settings`) or **Settings > Profile** (Mac). Your name goes into the Home greeting and every agent's prompt.

An install from before the config file existed writes one at its first boot from the old defaults and skips onboarding, so it keeps behaving as before.

## Placeholders in shared files

Crew charters and automation prompts can use these, filled from your config, so the shared files name nobody:

`{{user}}`, `{{workspace}}`, `{{reposDir}}`, `{{githubOwner}}`, `{{omniRoot}}`, `{{omniRepo}}`, `{{centralBrain}}`, `{{timezone}}`

## Server options

Optional. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` (gitignored) and uncomment what you need. It covers the port and host, the default model, permission mode, concurrency per harness, keepalive, browser flags, data and automations dirs, upload cap and reply suggestions (`OMNI_SUGGESTIONS=0` turns them off). Each line in `.env.example` says what it does.

## Secrets

Stored in the macOS Keychain under service `omni-os` (account `<scope>/<NAME>`). The database keeps names only. Manage them on the Secrets page (web) or **Settings > Secrets** (Mac).

- Scope `global` goes to every thread as an env var.
- Scope `channel:<slug>` goes only to that channel's threads and overrides a global with the same name.
- Billing and sync keys are kept out of a thread's terminal.
